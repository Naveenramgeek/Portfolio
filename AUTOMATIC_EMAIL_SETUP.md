# Automatic Email Setup - FormSubmit

Your contact form now uses **FormSubmit** - a free, reliable email service that requires minimal setup.

## How It Works

1. **Visitor fills form** → clicks "Send Message"
2. **FormSubmit processes the form** automatically
3. **Email is sent directly** to naveenvemula2487@gmail.com
4. **Success message appears** → form resets
5. **Done!** No additional steps required

## First-Time Setup (One-Time Only)

FormSubmit requires email verification on the first submission:

1. **Test your form** by filling it out yourself
2. **Check your email** (naveenvemula2487@gmail.com) for a verification email from FormSubmit
3. **Click the verification link** in the email
4. **Your form is now activated** for automatic emails!
